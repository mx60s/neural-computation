# Neural Computation Notebook Examples

**Course Description:** Explore basic mathematical concepts to neuroscience examples, and discuss the applications of these concepts more broadly and the interactions between neuroscience and other quantitative fields.

These notebooks are geared towards undergraduate neuroscience students with basic (hopefully) python experience. We explore concepts covered in class such as convolution, receptive fields, etc.
